\begin{itemize}
  \item Your group is already registered for the defense slot - no need to worry about that. Just don't cancel it because you won't get another one.
  \item Keep it simple - asking questions might make things more complicated.
  \item Follow the submission procedures for all your exercises (you know the drill).
  \item Make sure your program compiles! No compile = zero points. Pretty straightforward.
  \item Everyone needs to show up for the defense with your assigned team.
  \item Make sure everyone understands the whole project, even if you split up the work. Your final grade depends on whoever explains things worst during defense, so get everyone up to speed.
  \item Staying in touch with your team is on you. You've got phones, email, carrier pigeons, whatever... so no excuses about communication issues. Life isn't always fair, but that's just how it goes.
  \item If someone's completely MIA despite your best efforts, do the project anyway. We'll figure something out during defense. You'll still have access to submit even if the team leader goes missing.
  \item And of course, follow the Norm. Be thorough. And try to have some fun with it!

\begin{flushleft}
    It is a period of civil war.\\
    Rebel spaceships, striking from a\\
    hidden base, have won their first\\
    victory against the evil Galactic Empire.\\[1em]

    During the battle, Rebel spies managed\\
    to steal secret plans to the Empire's\\
    ultimate weapon, the DEATH STAR,\\
    an armored space station with enough\\
    power to destroy an entire planet.\\[1em]

    Pursued by the Empire's sinister agents,\\
    Princess Leia races home aboard her starship,\\
    custodian of the stolen plans that can save her\\
    people and restore freedom to the galaxy...

\begin{itemize}
  \item You're building a bot for the COREGAME using the 'connection' library. Pretty straightforward stuff.
  
  \item Your bot needs to be good enough to beat 10 enemy bots during evaluation.
  
  \item Name your bot after your team lead's intra name (don't mess this up).
  
  \item Check out these resources if you want to know more about coregame:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \href{https://youtu.be/gMmBgHnb8Nc?si=Thm0HOCfNIZbfCnI}{\texttt{Trailer}}

    \item \href{https://wiki.coregame.de}{\texttt{Coregame wiki}}
    \item \href{https://github.com/42core-team}{\texttt{Coremage github}}
  \end{itemize}
  
  \item Compiling your code is simple:
  
  \begin{minted}[frame=single,linenos]{c}
  make
  \end{minted}
  
  \item Want to see if your bot's any good? Challenge other teams and see how it holds up.
