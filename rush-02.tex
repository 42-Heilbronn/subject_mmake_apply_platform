\begin{itemize}
  \item Your group is already registered for the defense slot — no need to worry about that. Just don't cancel it because you won't get another one.
  \item Keep it simple - asking questions might make things more complicated.
  \item Follow the submission procedures for all your exercises (you know the drill).
  \item Make sure your program compiles! No compile = zero points. Pretty straightforward.
  \item Everyone needs to show up for the defense with your assigned team.
  \item Make sure everyone understands the whole project, even if you split up the work. Your final grade depends on whoever explains things worst during defense, so get everyone up to speed.
  \item Staying in touch with your team is on you. You've got phones, email, carrier pigeons, bees, whatever... so no excuses about communication issues. Life isn't always fair, but that's just how it goes.
  \item If someone's completely MIA despite your best efforts, do the project anyway. We'll figure something out during defense. You'll still have access to submit even if the team leader goes missing.
  \item And of course, follow the Norm. Be thorough. And try to have some fun with it!

\section*{\LARGE Foreword}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Foreword}

\begin{flushleft}
In the year 2542, as the burned remains of World War III ushered in \\
a fragile new beginning, Earth rose once more from the ashes of a \\
nuclear wasteland. Hidden aristocrats emerged from their secret \\
bunkers, resplendent in opulence, to reclaim a land both scarred \\
and grim. \\ [1em]

Across this ravaged realm, humanity had been twisted into ghastly \\
forms: ghostly skeletons wandered like lost souls, while ugly green \\
goblins — reminders of what once was — stalked the barren wilds. \\ [1em]

Driven by a perverse desire for luxury and brutal entertainment, \\
these aristocrats built vast arenas of horror. Within these \\
bloodstained colosseums, condemned creatures were forced to engage \\
in a savage dance for survival, their suffering displayed as a \\
repulsive show for those who delight in cruelty. \\ [1em]

Dear Strategist, this letter is not a request, it's an order — a \\
call to arms on the eve of battle. Your destiny, and indeed your \\
very life, are bound to the fate of these warriors. \\ [1em]

The time has come to gather your forces with precision and courage, \\
turning every command into a stroke of genius. Now, as you stand on \\
the brink of combat, let your resolve shine like a guiding light. \\ [1em]

Embrace the challenge and let your code strike true like a finely \\
honed blade. \\ [1em]

Onward — to glory! \\

\begin{itemize}
  \item You're building a bot for COREGAME using the 'connection' library. Pretty straightforward stuff.

  \item During evaluation, your bot will compete against enemy bots. Your points will depend on its performance in these matches.

  \item You must have a \href{https://github.com}{\texttt{GitHub}} account to do this project.

  \item To be able to start you need to clone your team's GitHub repository using ssh.

  \item Name your bot and team name after your team lead's intra name (don't mess this up).

  \item You will need these resources:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \href{https://youtu.be/gMmBgHnb8Nc?si=Thm0HOCfNIZbfCnI}{\texttt{Trailer}}
    \item \href{https://shattereddisk.github.io/rickroll/rickroll.mp4}{\texttt{Introduction}}
    \item \href{https://coregame.de}{\texttt{COREGAME website}}
    \item \href{https://42core-team.github.io/rush02-wiki/#/}{\texttt{COREGAME wiki}}
    \item \href{https://github.com/42core-team}{\texttt{COREGAME GitHub}}
  \end{itemize}

  \item If you use any other unit except warrior or worker you get -42 points.

  \newpage

  \item To get started you have to do the following:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Go to \href{https://coregame.de}{\texttt{https://coregame.de}} (login with your GitHub).
    \item Create a team and invite your teammates.
    \item Clone your repo.
    \item Type in \mintinline{bash}|make devcontainer|.
    \item Wait until VSCode started.
    \item Open a terminal and type in \mintinline{bash}|make|.
    \item Open your browser at \href{http://127.0.0.1}{\texttt{http://127.0.0.1}}.
    \item Have fun!
  \end{itemize}

  \item Want to see if your bot is any good? Challenge other teams and see how it holds up.
