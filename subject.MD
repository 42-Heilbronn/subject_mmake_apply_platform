## I Instructions

- The group WILL be registered to defense. Automatically. If one of of you cancels it, there won't be another one.
- Any question regarding the subject will probably complicate the subject.
- You have to follow the submission procedures for all your exercises.
- This subject could change up to an hour before submission.
- Moulinette compiles with the following flags: '-Wall -Wextra -Werror' and uses 'cc'.
- If your program doesn't compile, you'll get 0.
- You must therefore do the project with the imposed team and show up at the defense slot you've assigned, with all of your teammates.
- Each member of your group must be fully aware of the works of the project. Should you choose to split the workload, make sure you all understand what everybody's done. During defense, you'll be asked questions, and the final grade will be based on the worst explainations.
- Gathering the group is your responsibility. You've got all the means to get in contact with your teammates: phone, email, carrier pigeon, spiritism, etc. So don't bother blurping up excuses. Life isn't always fair, that's just the way it is.
- However, if you've really tried everything one of your teammates remains unreachable: do the project anyway, and we'll try and see what we can do about it during defense. Even if the group leader is missing, you still have access to the submission directory.
- It goes without saying, but your work must respect the Norm. Be thourough. And enjoy!

## II Foreword

It is a period of civil war.
Rebel spaceships, striking from a
hidden base, have won their first
victory against the evil Galactic Empire.

During the battle, Rebel spies managed
to steal secret plans to the Empire's
ultimate weapon, the DEATH STAR,
an armored space station with enough
power to destroy an entire planet.

Pursued by the Empire's sinister agents,
Princess Leia races home aboard her starship,
custodian of the stolen plans that can save her
people and restore freedom to the galaxy...
